"How the fuck does this fucking piece of sh... Oh wait, it's already logging my thoughts."

"Man... Where to start... You know what, let's start at the beginning of the day full of shit."

"It already was a hell to get on this plane... Leaving my old life behind was not that easy, but there's nothing left for me there. I'm in the sights of some old police officer and the new 'family' was not too accepting. For now om gone from those bad last years. Who knows I come back at some time in de present.  If I'm alive at least. Right now I'm flying in some shit plane to Night City. Heard some popular shithead dropped a nuke on a Corp building a while ago. Everything is still a fuckshow. Best time to get there the most unnoticed."

"This plane...

"A mom and child are watching some air. Probably a kids show of some kind.

"And a... Hold up, a waitress is asking me if I want a drink. Maybe time to taste a whisky everybody talking about? When I asked for one I get a cup of some clear liquid. Sounds nothing like they explained to me. As a take a sip of something that tastes like pure alcohol, this waitress explains it still needs an ampule. Way to much of a hassle for a fucking drink. Still tastes like shit afterwards.

"Looking in the plane there is are some people standing a bit out. Looks like I'm not the only one starting a new life. One business look-a-like dude who is looking like he lives in an office. A dude with piercings and shit is walking down the path to a girl and starts talking about a tattoo... I heard worse pick up lines... Hehe.

"And there is the sound of the voice telling us to land. Looking at the red sky and bit of wasteland I can see outside I know this is going to be a new beginning for me. Let's see where the city of opportunities gets me.

"Getting of the plane I'm held up by some dickfaces in uniforms. To my surprise the business dude, piercing guy and tattoo girl as well! All they want is to have a little chat... He... I know what they want to "chat" about. Assholes... After "giving a good reason" we decided to come with the dickfaces to some dim-lit fucking room.

"When tattoo girl sits down, she mumbles something and looks like she got a seizure. Something with flashing eyes or whatever. Dunno what exactly she's doing but I don't care either way at this point. Business dude seems like the most compliant one here. I can even give him some commando's and before you know, he is walking circles in the room! I like this one, he's funny. When Piercing is going to admire his ugly fucking mug in the mirror he scares the shit out of himself! Another idiot here. Hehe... Seizure/tattoo girl seems to get back to earth. Right as 2 dickfaces walks in with some hotshot dude behind them.

"Mister Hotshot calls himself Max Sharpley, some kind of NCPD inspector and wants us to do a job, probably something off-record.

"We get two choices:
1. "Do the fucking job, get paid (§500 up front and the rest after the job is complete) 
	"Perk: get access to Night Fucking City

2. "Don't do the fucking job
	"Con: get on the same plane back "home"

"Well, seeing as I don't have a home anymore where I came from it isn't that hard of a choice...

"The job is chasing some dark-skinned Corp dude carrying a suitcase. We can find him every day next to the Arasaka nuke site.

1. "We are the ones who needs to convince our Corp dude to part way with his suitcase. Doesn't matter which ways of "convincing" we use.

2. "After this we need to bring the suitcase to hotshot himself. We are not allowed to open said suitcase.

"More questions about corp dude are answered by "I dunno" by Hotshot. Seems like he doesn't care bout the corp dude. Makes the job easier.

Talking to the rest of the group, we finally share our names.

1. Seizure/tattoo girl is called Strix, has a lot of cybertech.
2. The boyfriend/piercing face calls himself Treetu. Works with some doctors hand thingy.
3. Funny business dude has the name Sjaakie the fourth or something. Is a handy lil fucker.
4. I told them I'm No1. Seems fitting as I try to start again with my life over here...

I tell mister Hotshot I only take the job if there are wheels involved. Says he has a pick-up getting rusty on the car lot. After that everyone agrees to take on the job. Seems like I'm not the only one who has his reasons to stay in the city. And apparently nobody likes to go back where they came from.

And oh boy... Hotshot told we he had a rusty pickup and oh god... IT IS A RUSTBUCKET! I like it! Engine feels a bit dead as well and it needs a bit of TLC all around. Maybe some upgrades? Time to take Rustbucket for a spin. Suddenly Piercing face shouts to stop, almost slams his face against the front chair, jumps out of the truck and runs to some poor woman in a cyber-psychosis and rips of her fucking arm... I mean, what fucking is happening here! As he dumps a cyber-arm in the back, I hit the gas and as fast (slow) as Rustbucket is, I try to get away. Hopefully nobody noted the plates... Time to get that changed as well... And if the day couldn't be any worse: some fuckface in a hot-rod was trying "racing" us. Dude's way quicker than I am, mocks Rustbucket and spins away... Tried to keep my cool, but I don't think it went too well..

We agreed to drop off the couple at the clinic for some work on Tattoo, while Sjaakie and I are going for a garage to work on Rustbucket. At the clinic Piercing keeps waving the cyber-arm in my face and tells me it would be better my meat one. Next he smacks me in the face with that thing. As I grab him by the throat and lift him a few inch of the ground the girlfriend aim her hardware on me, telling "we going to need this guy in the future". This guy is not worth the fight... So I'm smack him to the ground and leave them behind. I knew they were together! Still strange to get different seats on a plane...

Arriving at the shop we are greeted by 2 woman(?) whose arms are thicker then mine, with a thick changing German accent. Sjaakie tries to negotiate a price for renting a place to work on Rustbucket. Little dude, big ladies. He he, funny show. After I got involved the dropped the price, let us work, supplied some (used) parts and eventually joined us in getting Rustbucket back on it's feet. Even got nitro installed and a changing license plate holder. Nice... And I must say, Sjaakie is quite a techie... I'm really surprised with him...

Afterwards we call the couple. Strix their cyber work is already done and apparently they are sipping whisky in a bar called Lizzies. Driving over there Rustbucket feel way better and smoother. Nitro works amazing too! Arriving at lizzies I see this big ass neon-sign on a strip club. At the front a USSR gorilla stands guard, calls himself Dimitri. Dude gives Sjaakie a настровья (some green stuff). Shit almost glows. He... This is going to be fun... After this shit we're finally going inside.

The couple orders whisky when we enter. Tells us this is better stuff then on the plane. When the bartender gives us our drinks, she tells us that that it's on the tab of someone else... I don't like shit like this. Looking at some black guy, who paid for this shit, he lift his glass as well. Next the sheep around him stands up. One of them comes over and asks us to join the table. Dude tells us his name is Guillaime Nekumbo, starts making fun of our names, calls Nomad family shit and continues to offer us the same fucking job we are already on for double the Eddies. The only catch here is he gets the suitcase, of course unopened and if we fail or deliver the suitcase to Hotshot instead of his gang (Tiger Claws if I'm correct), he'd put a price on our heads... Fucking woohoo... Oh... And he wants to know by tomorrow what our answer is... Well, guess we're completely fucked... Motherfucker... After this fucking signing of a fucking death warrant he still has the fucking guts of offering us a room in this fucking building. For the first fucking time Piercing finally got a good idea in his head for another place to get some rest... Apparently he got some beds in the clinic he worked on his girlfriend. After downing our drinks and silently driving over there he got us inside via the back door (he he). And shit man... I was tired. I quickly went to one of the appointed rooms and lay down on the bed...

Man... What a day... Amanda... Lilly... I hope you can't see me in the shit I am right now... I was hoping of finding a better place after losing you and the rest of the family. It seems like running away got me nowhere better than on the other side of the ocean... Damned... The couple are getting a room together as far as I can hear... He... Why not, we might be death by tomorrow anyways...

I set Lilly's unicorn on the bedside table next to me. "Hope you will forgive me for leaving you behind that day..."
