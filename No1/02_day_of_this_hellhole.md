The couple is already up and running. Tattoo is in the hallway doing her hacking shit by a vending machine. Gets me a cheap coffee and a some snacks. Forgot to log yesterday that Piercing finally trade in the arm yesterday for hardware for his girlfriend. Trade in her eyes... I still don't get why people want to trade in their working body parts. Always thought it was nice to have something whenever you lose something, but not because you want...Anyway... This day... Seems like we have a murder to do. I think this isn't Strix and Treetu's first rodeo. I'm not so sure about Sjaakie... He seems he can handle himself though. But killing someone? We'll see. 

Sjaakie asks if anyone wants some of their shit upgraded. Don't have anything but it get's funny when he ask for the bow of Piercing. Dude is hellbent that he don't even get's to touch the bow. Need to remember that. Treetu still askes for explosive arrows which to my surprise Sjaakie says he can make that shit with stuff from the hardware store! 

We decide to discuss a plan while driving to the hardware store. Long story short: we have explosive arrows and decided we'll going to scout and adapt to the situation. While driving I got to show the couple our upgrades! Thought I heard Piercings neck snapping when I put on the nitro! hehhehhee... 

When we arrive at the spot. Right in front of us is a big hole in the ground with something that looks like a fence around. The couple suggest they will be scouting from above. As long they stay focused on the job I guess... Sjaakie and I stay in the car driving around looking out for a big ass Corpo car. After a little while we'll see a big limo drive past us. I turn around. Before I can signal the couple, Strix's already calling me. I park the car a little bit away from the Corp dude, who left the limo with 2 of his goons. In a few sec we have a plan. Strix creates a distraction, Sjaakie will be planting a 'nade in the right goon while Treetu tries to explode the left one. I'm on the case duty. Strix starts with the distraction. As I get out of the Rustbucket with my trusty shotgun there's an explosion first left and 0.1 sec later right of the corp fuck as well. As he's confused/distracted I unload my shotgun at him while walker closer.

One hit, two hits, shoots back and hits me. Think I cracked a rib... Fuck that hurts... Still: "pain is the way to make sure you are alive". So I shoot the fucker again and he drops on his knees. One of his goons is laying lifeless on the floor. The other is holding up. Idiot starts to talk as I ask him what's in the case. Fucker tells us he doesn't know. Looks like this is going to be the answer for the rest of our questions.

Before we get to ask more questions, the black fuck begins to foam out of his mouth. Fucking cyanide... Heard crazy stories about wars where they replace teeth with this crap in case someone was being interrogated. Crack the fake teeth open to kill oneself. The last goon does this as well. Pull the trigger right in the face of the moron in front of me and watch them fall down the pit. 

At least we have the suitcase...

We all get in Rustbucket and I push the pedal to the metal. In some way we managed to get the suitcase... And shit my ribs still hurts like fuck... Anyway. As we are driving we discuss what's going to be next... Or we are getting deported by the NCPD, or we get a death warrant by the Russian fuckfaces... And still don't know why people are after this fucking thing. 

Sjaakie suggests we use the Medical Centers x-ray machine to get a scan. Strix suggests we play the NCPD and Russian mob against each other. Sounds like a good plan. Cause no-one gives us a guarantee if we deliver the suitcase, they're gonna kill us anyway. Let's see where this is going...
