## `Take-Off//Skyfall`  
When I wake up, Strix has left the room already. I find her in the hallway hacking into the vending machine. She so provides breakfast for Sjaakie, No1, herself and me. After a cup of coffee and a good snack we need to leave the clinic, as Amber requested.  
Outside Sjaakie asks if we need anything upgraded. He asks about my bow, but he ain't touching that! I ask for a bunch of explosive arrows. A bit later, I've got some nice explosive arrows to use! I like this guy! He's more handy then I thought beforehand!  
  
We plan to do some scouting of the area already where our target will be. We head to the car and "Damn! Did they install `nitrous oxide` in it? Great to know we've got **that** in stock! Oh, and a license plate changer? Handy if I need a *free hand* and we're seen!" No1 puts hit the peddle to the metal and almost directly tries out his nitroes. We're pushed in the back of our seats while we fly high-speed through the streets of NC. Great ride, this barrel has become!  
  
A few minutes and half a whiplash later, we arrive at what is said to be the location our target is to arrive. No1 and Sjaakie decide they stay in the car driving in the neighborhood ("Hah! Chickens!") while Strix and I scout from above. Strix is up in no-time because of her grappling hook and kicks down the fire escape. I climb up and we're in position. We do some chatter while Strix scans the premises with her `TeleOptics`. After a while, a big white limousine arrives. Two armed goons step out of the car and our taget follow. He's standing there, just doing nothing--waiting for the pickup.  
  
We call No1 and Sjaakie. They arrive only a few seconds after. Strix hacks the lights to flicker as a distraction. I activate my `Sandevistan` and get ready for my first shot. "Aim and *loose*!" An explosive arrow blows away one of the fucking goons. "Bullseye motherfucker!" Sjaakie aims his `Shoulder Arms` and burrows a grenade in the other goon. No1 steps out of the truck walking into the target. He pumps his shotgun and blows the target. A few shots are fired in our direction. Strix descends in no-time. I start sliding down the fire exit and we're now all on the ground. I take an other shot at the goon who shoots to Strix. Sjaakie also releases an other shot on his goon who falls over again! "Hah! Suck on this assholes!" No1 takes an other shot while Strix does the same. A few shots later, both goons are down. No1 pumps again and the target is down.  
  
"We've won motherfuckers!" Now it's up to us to decide what to do with that fucking suitcase. Sjaakie suggests we'll put in in an `Xray` at the clinic. "Great plan from this mute, for once!" We take the suitcase and all step into the car and leave the premises ASAP...  

## `Trust//Betrayal`  
So we finally got the damn suitcase! Good for us! We're directly heading for the Clinic and find it all empty. "Well, then at least we don't have to bribe Amber to access the X-Ray machine!"  
A few moments later, we hook up the suitcase to the X-Ray and get started. The results are, well, they suck! Gladly Sjaakie is around and after a small bit of rewiring and such we finally get some results. Not something we can work with, but it looks like a heart-kinda thing.
